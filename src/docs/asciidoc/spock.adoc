== Spock
Spock is a testing framework that uses Groovy as a language and leverages many Groovy features to simplify testing. It uses JUnit as test runner and is therefore supported in all environments that support JUnit.

For complete documentation see http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/latest/index.html

=== Setup

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::../../../build.gradle[tags=setup]
----
<1> needed because the tests are groovy files
<2> optional dependency to enable mocking of classes

=== Fixture Methods

[source, goovy]
----
def setup() {}          // <1>
def cleanup() {}        // <2>
def setupSpec() {}      // <3>
def cleanupSpec() {}    // <4>
----
<1> run before every feature method
<2> run after every feature method
<3> run before the first feature method
<4> run after the last feature method

=== Feature Methods

Every public no argument method that either has an `expect:` block or both `when:` and `then:` is considered a test case -- or feature method in Spock lingua.
By convention, the method should be a complete sentence and be defined as string.

[source, groovy]
----
def "the size of a list is 0 after construction() {
    expect:
    new ArrayList().size() == 0
}
----

=== Feature Method blocks

setup/given:: for setup code only needed for this feature method (as opposed to a setup-method)

when-then:: when I do x, then y should be z

[source, groovy]
----
when:
def x = 2 * 2

then:
x == 4
----

expect:: alternative for when-then

[source, groovy]
----
expect:
2 * 2 == 4
----

cleanup:: for cleanup code only needed for this feature method (as opposed to a cleanup-method)
where:: for data driven tests (will be explained later)

=== Enforces Behavior Driven Design
A test class must extend `spock.lang.Specification`. Every public method that either has an `expect:` block or both `when:` and `then:` is considered a test case.

=== Annotations as a means to documentation
Spock supports some annotations for documentation purposes.

* Title
* Narrative
* Subject
* Issue

@Issue("32817")
def "calls to findFreeDepartureNames on date change are executed in order"() {
    ...
}

=== Extensions
Spock allows to extend its behavior using extensions.
Most of them can be applied locally by using an annotation.
Spock ships with some annotations and extensions.
See http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/latest/extensions.html

`@Ignore`:: Same as JUnits Ignore
[source, groovy]
----
@Ignore("fails sometimes")
def "very flaky test"() {...}
----

`@IgnoreIf`/`@Requires`:: Ignore based on some condition
[source, groovy]
----
@IgnoreIf({ os.windows })
def "test that does not run on windows"() {...}

@Requires({ sys.itest })
def "integration test for blah"() {...}
----

`@IgnoreRest`:: Ignore all but one test

`@PendingFeature`:: Execute the test, but mark as ignored, as long as it fails. Once it succeeds, mark as failure. The use case is to annotate tests that can not yet run but should already be committed. The main difference to Ignore is that the tests are executed, but test failures are ignored. If the test passes without an error, then it will be reported as failure since the PendingFeature annotation should be removed. This way the tests will become part of the normal tests instead of being ignored forever.

`@Stepwise`:: Execute the test methods in the exact order of their declaration in the groovy file

`@Timeout`:: Can be used on tests, that might introduce a deadlock

`@RestoreSystemProperties`:: Can be used for tests that alter System Properties to automatically restore the properties

`@AutoCleanup`:: Automatically cleanup resources
[source, groovy]
----
@AutoCleanup("disconnect")
def connection = connect()
----

`@Shared`:: Can be used instead of `static`. Marks a variable that is shared between tests.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::../../../build.gradle[tags=spock-reports]
----
<1> defaults to build/spock-reports
<2> defaults to also show blocks without description
