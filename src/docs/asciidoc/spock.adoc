== Spock
Spock is a testing framework that uses Groovy as a language and leverages many Groovy features to simplify testing. It uses JUnit as test runner and is therefore supported in all environments that support JUnit.

=== Enforces Behavior Driven Design
A test class must extend `spock.lang.Specification`. Every public method that either has an `expect:` block or both `when:` and `then:` is considered a test case.
